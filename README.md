## Introduction
The goal of this project is to train a self-supervised learning model on a dataset of AI-generated art and human-generated art, and transfer it to downstream tasks to try to distinguish them. To achieve this goal, we constructed a data set containing 900 art pictures in 3 different art styles to ensure the internal balance of the data. We trained our model on this dataset and simulated different situations with the proportion of labeled data in the dataset. Ultimately, our self-supervised learning model achieved competitive results with fully supervised learning.

## Dataset
This dataset was created by ourselves and contains 450 human artworks and 450 AI-generated artworks. The repository contains two example images from the dataset; the link to the dataset is
